**Friday: Scrum Master Bea ðŸ’ª**

# Stand-up:

Yesterday was a good day. Back end deployed, API blocker fixed, now we just need to prepare the presentation.

**PRESENTATION FEEDBACK**

From other groups, relevant to us perhaps:

- Start with a succinct, clearly written out sprint goal â†’ and whether or not it was hit.
- User story top left; then status (discovery, design, build, deploy); this gives viewers high level
- Have picky front-end designer blitz through and notice points of friction and little fixed
- Tailwind comes with aria stuff built in so good for accessibility (look this up so we can use it for our final pres!)
- Users are great at telling you about their pain but less good about telling you the solutions they want
- Business stakeholders want to get their heads around whatâ€™s going on and where youâ€™re at ASAP. A little status pill saying (deployed, discovery, etcâ€¦) and a status pill for the sprint target (met, or not met)
- Recommended to demo in MOBILE before the demo in DESKTOP

**From our presentation**

- Demo the app a little earlier
- Add a bit more energy!
- What people care about in demos and reviews: give very QUICK context, and give an overarching outline of the sprint goal and whether or not you hit it, then step into it with a demo.
- The demo is for the end of the SPRINT not the project.
