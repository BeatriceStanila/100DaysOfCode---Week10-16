**Wednesday: Scrum Master Tom[ðŸ’ª](https://emojipedia.org/flexed-biceps/)**

# Stand-up:

Plan today: build out models and routes for backend; Tom and Ryan do CSS styling when back using CSS Modules; Jo and Bee continue working on next.js frontend â†’ first implement the useEffect. Bee shared database link so all add that to their .env files. Also create a delete route and model so that items can be unfavourited. Then, at the end look at deployment!

Tom persuaded everyone to use tailwind!

Hamza recommends render for the backend and netlify for thefront end, given that vercel is causing problems for other groups

# Retro:

- Backend went well! It is ready to be deployed, models and routes are all in order, and testing is completed and all passing.
- Front end also went well â†’ pacing is going according to plan, and thereâ€™s only the last little bit to get done thatâ€™s all ready from the prototype. Knowledge sharing is going well, and Axios is being successfully used!
- Tailwind is going well! Styling is on the way, background image is

Plan for tomorrow: Go through the last API call together to wrap up results page functionality; finish results page; share Axios with Ryan;

**AGILE POINT!** â†’ Vercel has been causing issues with other teams. We WERE going to use it (because weâ€™re using Next.js) BUT on the recommendation of coaches we are now deploying on Render (back) and Netlify (front)
