**Thursday: Scrum Master Tariq ðŸ’ª**

# Stand-up:

Should deploy the back end, polish up API calls for the results page, and then we can get on to styling the results page. This shouldnâ€™t be too bad as tomâ€™s styling is in progress. All thatâ€™s really left is to build carousel. Bee and jo do results page. Ryan Tariq and Victoria do back end deployment.

Remember to run and debug!

ARSHI MEETING: Recommended we read [this](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app) to look at maintaining state between pages, if we want to have two separate pages. Itâ€™s like the equivalent of lifting state, but allows you to lift it up to the ROOT level (\_app.js) so it persists even whilst navigating different pages.

# Retro:

Today was a great day! We unblocked the api calls and image rendering. Once Tom has researched, we tomorrow make a decision on whether we want to switch to make it a single page app or use custom pages. Plan for tomorrow: decide on the page, then work on the presentation. And, potentially, deploy the front end? We need to prepare this!
