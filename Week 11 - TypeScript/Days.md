New Pair: Stephanie

✅ Day 64: Coachbase workshop

✅ Day 65 & 66 : TypeScript

- is a compiler that builds on top of JS

- Describing primitives (strings, numbers, booleans, etc)
- Describing the shape of an object to TypeScript
- Describing an array (and its contents) to TypeScript
- Adding type annotations for variables, function parameters, function return values

- can use type annotations to specify the data types of variables and function parameters

- this allows the TypeScript compiler to catch potential type errors before the code is run, making it easier to identify and fix bugs

- when working with React components, you can use type annotations to specify the types of props and state that a component expects to receive.

- this can help to ensure that the component is being used correctly and that it has the necessary data to function properly

✅ Day 67: had a closer look into debugging and how to use the Visual Studio Debugger

✅ Day 68: Build a WeatherApp with Typescript
