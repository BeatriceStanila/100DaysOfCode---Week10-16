Thursday: Scrum Master Tom ðŸ’ª

# Stand-up:

Review of the navbar and styling stuff. Weird gap is fixed as well as nav bar. One fix was NOT adding a class name in one case so it wasnâ€™t â€˜hiddenâ€™ BUT still on the dom (and therefore taking up space), one was disallowing overflow on the x axis. Footer cramped Linkedin icons problem is fixed. We should probably make the hamburger menu bigger for accessibility issues, and make the nav visible on tablet.

Things to consider: why did we deploy backend on render and not on Netlify? When it would have been better to do both on one end.

NB: If you design desktop to these dimensions it will look good on all desk
