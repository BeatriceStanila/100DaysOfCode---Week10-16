**Wednesday: Scrum Master Tariq ðŸ’ª**

# Stand-up:

We are in a good position! MVP is ready, should look into bugs. E.g., some of the cities arenâ€™t coming up so we need to look at the filter. Favourites has small bug to fix. Styling needs to get up to speed 100%. Add a note when nothing comes back from the API too. We need to make sure weâ€™re really gone through and caught all the bugs! And worth everyone deploying with different API keys. Right now we are using Joâ€™s

# Retro:

GREAT day: fixing lots of bugs, still trying to wrap up that bit where â€˜no results foundâ€™ shows in the searchbar. We need to focus on presentations tomorrow mornig before polishingup final bugs and bits, but this should be doable.

MOVIE TIME (watching previous presentations) - notes:

- Ten second introductions - deliver with energy!
- Try and keep audio recordings from each laptop at equal volumes
- One video did: intros, problem outline, app demo & walkthrough (including explaining details like what data persists, why different design and functionality decisions have been made)
- Donâ€™t rush with delivery
- Nice to see inset tile with speakerâ€™s screen - would be nice to also have their name here!
- Add 404 message to our journal page
- Donâ€™t be reading from a script, e specially if that script is on the screen
- Looks a little messy when thereâ€™s too much text on the screen
- Ensure even spread of speaking time
