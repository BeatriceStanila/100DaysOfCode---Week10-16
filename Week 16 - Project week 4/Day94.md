**Monday**: Scrum Master Jo ðŸ’ª

# Stand-up:

We want to keep some slides with our sprint goals for next one. Tweaking last bits and piece of funtionality and styling - and merge all to main expecting that there will be some bugs. We are looking to deploy end of day.

ðŸª²ðŸª²ðŸª² BUGS:ðŸª²ðŸª²ðŸª²

- if search bar is empty and you click search, it throws an axios error
- see if we can get enter button to work on search
- Sometimes the search button doesnâ€™t work, sometimes you have to wait a bit and then it works - and sometimes it doesnâ€™t allow you click into the text input field to start typing
- Link up email/password login to the favourites post/deleting
- style â€˜see moreâ€™ anchor tag so it looks like a button
- Currently duplicates are possible on favourites page, so add similar thing to favs route handler as is in user route handler
- Carousel currently goes on top of footer
- Change logo

# Retro:

We did not deploy, BUT! The app MVP is fully functioning and working. Styling is looking good, and we have compiled a list of bugs to wrap up this week. Tomorrow plan is to deploy front end first thing, and possibly remove useEffect to improve performance.
