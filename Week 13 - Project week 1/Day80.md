Friday

âœ… Scrum Master: Ryan

âœ… Stand-up:

- Complete colour scheme
- High Fidelity wireframe
- Backend planning
- Component Tree

Started testing API hypothesis: is it feasible to do 12 API calls for just ten results so that we can pull image results for the initial display?

We will document as we go along by adding detailed inline commenting. If thereâ€™s time at the end, we will go through to add jsDocs commenting to the functions

Jo began adding screenshot documentation

âœ… Retro:

Successes:

- Began splitting up into smaller teams
- The future looks bright!
- Teamwork is going very strong!
- We have managed to keep abreast of some major obstacles that could otherwise have been HORRIBLE if we came across them during code

Concerns:

- Using typescript!
- Fitting in the planning for API hypothesis
- We are a wee bit behind schedule - we need to finish planning asap on monday
- We need to be precise with timings and commenting so that things can keep rolling at a good pace

ðŸ”¸we selected a color theme, completed the high-fidelity wireframe

ðŸ”¸and experimented with the OpenTripMap API to see what data we could use

ðŸ”¸we also determined the technologies we'll be using to build our travel companion app.

ðŸ”¸as homework for the weekend, we'll be exploring next.js
