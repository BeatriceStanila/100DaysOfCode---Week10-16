## Retro meeting

✅ held a Disney ideation session for the top two ideas and successfully collaborated as a team to choose the most appropriate one

- we are going to build a travel app ✈️

✅ we also created a survey to gather insight on our users' needs and shared it with our peers for their input

- we were good at keeping each other on track with timings and we successfully collaborated on picking the most appropriate idea as a team.
