Thursday

✅ Scrum Master: me

- had the opportunity to serve as the Scrum Master for the day, which definitely took me out of my comfort zone.

✅ Stand-up:

- begin with looking over user data
- then decide MVP and stretch goals looking at good to have, should have, could have
- build user stories
- then pick colour scheme with colour theory and app branding in mind
- low-fidelity wire frame also
- finish the napkin plan including deciding on tech stack tools, using MVP as a guide
- Stretch goal for today: component tree.

✅ Retro:

- Have mostly completed the tasks for the day.

- The user survey data was useful to analyse

- Completed must/should/won’t have for the MVP. We’ve kept it realistic

- The user persona was useful to help us focus.

- Low-fidelity wireframe led to high-fidelity wireframe, which was efficient and successful.

- Have tentatively arrived at colour scheme.

- Teamwork was good, we did Roman voting when things didn’t work - especially as a group of six.

- There were some design direction conflicts that we navigated by sticking to conflict resolution manifesto points.

- Baseline baseline MVP helps us to clarify objectives.

Tomorrow should be final day of planning, look to begin building on Monday.
