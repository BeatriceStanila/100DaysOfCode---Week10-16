# What is a static website?

Static websites consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are served to the client's browser and displayed to the user. They are simple, fast, and easy to maintain, and are suitable for small websites with simple content and minimal interactivity. Examples of static websites include portfolios, personal blogs, and informational websites.

# What is a dynamic website?

A dynamic website is a website that generates content on the fly, in response to user interactions or changes in data. Dynamic websites are powered by server-side code, such as PHP, Ruby on Rails, or Node.js, which retrieves data from a database and generates HTML pages to be sent to the client's browser.
