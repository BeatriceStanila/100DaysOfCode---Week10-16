**Wednesday: Scrum Master Victoria ðŸ’ª**

# Stand-up:

Polish up: auth notes, post/delete functionality for hearts, move â€˜no duplicate userâ€™ function to the backend route/model, add results filter to API call logic, Ryan polish up wireframe

CODE REVIEW:

We are now using UID to pull user favourites! This will allow us to remove one of the pull requests and will hopefully speed up user experience.

# Retro:

Custom react firebase hooks with email / password authorisation is working! Database has been updated to reflect UID change, as has the back end with routes and models.

# Plan for tomorrow:

clean up branches. DOUBLE CHECK that uid is being passed down to the card (and therefore the endpoint), and also the add user endpoint. Configure email/password auth to send info to database. Possibly deployment for front end? Conditional rendering for carousel and results, which should be pretty easy. Conditional rendering for nav bar (login/logout button, favourites, journal, profile image). Finalise favourites page to adjust how it does fetch request. Decide on design adjustments and polish it all up.
