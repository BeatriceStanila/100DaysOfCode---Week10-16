Thursday: Scrum Master Ryan ðŸ˜ˆ

# Stand-up:

1hr45min + 1hr30min. Not a lot of time!

# Retro:

Didnâ€™t get around to deployment! But Bea/Tom/Ryan worked on polishing up auth. Still to do: post functionality! Work out how to connect up the post/delete branch that T/J/V were working on can be combined with the branch where auth has multiple components/page.

Progress was good but thereâ€™s going to be a lot to work out and mop up tomorrow, so we will have to be sharper with how we arrange our time. We also need to improve communication - for example, we wound up working on the same ticket across two different teams. Perhaps ensure our tickets are VERY clearly and precisely defined.
