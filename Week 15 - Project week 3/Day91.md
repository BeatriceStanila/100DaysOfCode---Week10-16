**Friday: Scrum Master Bee ðŸ’ª**

# Stand-up:

We have conflicts now! We were working on the nav bar, which now is removed with auth. Suggestion for how to avoid working on the same thing: clearly decide on the scope of tickets together before beginning. Put this on the card! And let others know when the ticket is complete. Idea is to finish with the functionality today and then deploy in the afternoon. We need to work out if UID is possible with email and login. Most likely, weâ€™ll leave this out for now and just gesture towards it in the presentation. We will KEEP the journal page in there, but not add any functionality for now. Add loading wheel. We do also need to change the styling. Code merge needs to happen this morning!!

NADEEM DISCUSSION: two videos needed, one thatâ€™s 2 mins, the other thatâ€™s 15-20 mins. That short 2 min video is probably what we will show on the actual demo day, NOT the full big demo. But the coaches are going to send us through a brief for that. We really want to get this tight! An example of a recommended and GOOD presentation is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cueSGiAX_BY). We also want to pack in a code review, maybe we could dedicate a day to this?

# Retro:

Weekend tickets are defined, hopefully weâ€™ll be in position to merge frontend on monday. Good progress made with functionality.
