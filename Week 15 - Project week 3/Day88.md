**Tuesday: Scrum Master Jo ðŸ’ª**

# Stand-up:

We have split into three teams to work smarter, not harder, and will be focusing on implementing basic auth following from last nightâ€™s session; getting the heart delete conditionally done, and building out the favourites page.

Mobile version: the web app is designed to be mobile-forward so all we really need to do to add gesture responsiveness so that the card pop-ups work. We can add any more details as stretch goals, but should get this design aspect wrapped up this week.

# Retro:

We are going to separate out the functionality in the heart button (login/pos favourites) so that we keep the code cleaner.

Team work was good today! The pace was nice, and the progress was good. Nice to see so much progress done with auth, the favourites page, and the heart toggle with the functionality with it.
