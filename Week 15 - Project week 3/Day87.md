**Monday**: Scrum Master Tom **[ðŸ’ª](https://emojipedia.org/flexed-biceps/)**

# Stand-up:

We need to crack the auth nut! Break off into research task teams for the first hour looking at Auth0, Next Auth, and Firebase so we can decide which one to implement. Alongside, another team merges the CSS branch with main and works on adding favourites button, and linking the results display with the results from the API call.

# Retro:

Firebase has been problematic but a lot of progress has been made with research! Sorted out mixed up files and codebases where the wires got crossed. Got search results to show up on display tiles, and added heart button to tiles that has post functionality.

Tomorrow plan is to build out favourite page, finish front end functionality (hook up delete route, add conditional rendering for search/results display, add conditional rendering for heart icon), get baseline baseline auth. We need to look at firebase react hooks!
