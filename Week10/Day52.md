✅ Codewars

✅ Did the agile retrospective for the last week project

What can I improve for my next project?

- plan more, not less
- open communication
- add comments throughout the code
- work on the frontend as well as backend
- do more testing from the beginning
- git flow - protect the main branch !!!

✅ New topic - code review

Code reviews are methodical assessments of code designed to identify bugs, increase code quality, and help developers learn the source code.

<b>Why are code reviews important?</b>

- developing a strong code review process sets a foundation for continuous improvement and prevents unstable code from shipping to customers

<b>What are the benefits of code reviews?</b>

1. Share knowledge

   - when software developers review code as soon as a team member makes changes, they can learn new techniques and solutions

   - help junior developers learn from more senior team members, similar to how pair programming effectively helps developers share skills and ideas

   - ensure that no person is a single point of failure

   - everyone has the ability to review and offer feedback

2. Discover bugs earlier

   - rather than discovering bugs after a feature has been shipped and scrambling to release a patch, developers can immediately find and fix problems before customers ever see them

   - moving the review process earlier in the software development lifecycle through unit tests helps developers work on fixes with fresh knowledge

   - when waiting until the end of the lifecycle to do a review, developers often struggle to remember code, solutions, and reasoning

3. Maintain compliance

   - if teams want to have a standard coding style, code reviews help everyone adhere to the same standards

   - peer reviews bring in maintainers to assess the code before pushing changes.

4. Enhance security

   - create a high level of security, especially when security professionals engage in a targeted review

   - application security is integral in software development, and code reviews help ensure compliance

   - security team members can review code for vulnerabilities and alert developers to the threat.

5. Increase collaboration

   - when team members work together to create a solution, they feel more ownership of their work and a stronger sense of belonging

   - it’s important to strengthen collaboration across the software development lifecycle to prevent information silos and maintain a seamless workflow between teams

<b>What are the disadvantages of code reviews?</b>

1. Longer time to ship

   - the review time could delay the release process, since reviewers have to collaborate with authors to discuss problems

2. Pull focus from other tasks

3. Large reviews mean longer review times

✅ Reviewed another group’s project and gave feedback to one another
