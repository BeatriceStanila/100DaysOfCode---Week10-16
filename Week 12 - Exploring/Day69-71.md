ðŸ”¸ Introduction to DevOps

- is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams

- A DevOps team includes developers and IT operations working collaboratively throughout the product lifecycle, in order to increase the speed and quality of software deployment.

- it aims to automate the software deployment process, allowing for faster and more efficient delivery of software updates and new features.

- DevOps practices include continuous:
  - integration and continuous deployment, which automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software
  - as well as infrastructure as code, which allows infrastructure to be managed and provisioned using code rather than manual configuration
- DevOps also promotes a culture of experimentation, learning, and continuous improvement.
