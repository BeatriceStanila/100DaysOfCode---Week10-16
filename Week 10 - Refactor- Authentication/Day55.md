âœ… Authentication and Authorization

**What is AUTHENTICATION?? AuthN**

- is the process of a user presenting some credentials (username, password, biometrics like face scan) and receiving access to a system.
- it usually happens once per session

**What is AUTHORIZATION?? AuthZ**

- happens after authentication
- happens each time a user access a resource.
- determines whether an authenticated user has permission to access a certain resource and if it doesnâ€™t they are denied access

These two processes work together to keep your API secure
